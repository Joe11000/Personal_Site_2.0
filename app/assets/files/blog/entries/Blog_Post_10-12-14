I was riding the struggle bus for about 5 hours. Wow did that take forever. I couldn't get the assets pipeline to display only the stylesheets I wanted instead of loading every asset file on each page (images, css, js)

Here is what actually worked before we go into all the ways that didn't work. Don't worry about reading those unless you want to. Otherwise just skip that part and just take the nugget of success.


WHAT I WANTED
  Home page to only load the assets it needed by isolating

WHAT I GOT TO WORKED
  I have one layout that always retrieves the application.css and application.js to load any global stylings and javascript that is shared between controllers and jquery + twitter bootstrap, but the layout also retrieves assets particular its controller. For convience, I isolated these assets in subfolders of assets/javascripts and assets/stylesheets.


WRONG PATHS

  tried to make 2 application manifests, (application.js and blog/blog_application.js) I think this can be come similarly but with blog/blog.js as the index, but I just couldn't get the directives to require what I needed without throwing an error.

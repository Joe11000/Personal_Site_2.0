Problem : SVG keeps running into issues when running in Firefox vs Chrome. Firefox you are so good to me. If I wasn't biased to Chrome already, then you would be my go to for development. Firefox likes to run without specifiying '-webkit-' in front of every animation property and Firefox doesn't understand that line if you do....So you have to duplicate your properties for svg to get it working in both browsers.

Possible Solution : I just came across Vectorjs and Snap.svg. They could potentially be helpful. All I really need is probably one or two fix in my current code, but these could be good for the future. Vectorjs boasts an animation speed boost by using javascripts animation queue instead of the 'slower' jQuery method. It also claims a small library size only a 9KB size as well as a bunch of other things. This could be good but I really don't want to have to learn all about this library to fix a one or two liner in my app.
Snap.svg is the most dedicated svg library and I don't know too much about it, but if I was going to go for one of these, then it would be Vectorjs due to the amount of features it has. i don't know how either of them do cross platform. Which is my main issue here.

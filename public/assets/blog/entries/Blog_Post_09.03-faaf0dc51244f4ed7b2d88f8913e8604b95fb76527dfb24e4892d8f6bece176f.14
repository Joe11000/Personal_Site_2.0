Old Blog Posts. Need to see if still relevent or if I should just start over.
Today I am getting a big jump on this blog application that will encorporate CanCan Autherntication for accessing content of the application and Devise for the authenticating the user initially and some of its other cool features: email password confirmation

The world really needs another blog. No really it does. So I will be the one to give it to the world. Your welcome.



I am using this site as a reference "Rails Authentication with Devise and CanCan â€“ Customizing Devise Controllers"
